# Properties, Types, and Tests

The main task in property-based testing is coming up with the properties for the code under test. In this section we get some practice at this crucial step. We'll focus on fairly simple functions, and develop a library of properties we can reuse in more complicated situations.

## Symmetries and Preconditions

Let's start with a very familiar function: addition. To make it more interesting we'll consider first the integers we use in mathematics and then the `Int` type in Scala. What properties could you test in each case? Three properties is a good number, and with a bit of effort you might come up with more. Work on this before you read on.

For the mathematical integers, you might consider properties such as the following. In the below `x`, `y`, and `z` are always integers.

- *closure*: for any two integers `x` and `y`, `z = x + y` is also an integer
- *identity*: `x + 0 = x = 0 + x`
- *associativity*: `(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)`
- *commutativity*: `x + y = y + x`
- *invertibility*: for every `x` there is an integer `-x` such that `x + -x = 0`

These are the basic properties of addition. We could expand out to other properties, such as addition of odd and even numbers, if we were so inclined.

When we look at machine integers (i.e. `Int`) things get a bit more complex, due to overflow and wrapping. Let's consider the properties we developed for mathematical integers and see how they apply to machine integers.

- *closure*: still holds
- *identity*: still holds
- *associativity*: still holds
- *commutativity*: still holds
- *invertibility*: does not hold for `Int.MinValue`

There are two big points we can take away from this exercise. 

The first is about the nature of properties. The properties given above will apply in many cases, and we can use the list above as a reference for discovering properties of other systems. More generally the properties are mostly kinds of *symmetries*---different arrangements of additions that lead to the same result. We can use this more general idea to find properties by looking for symmetries in our system under test.

*also describe properties as (universally, etc.) quantified assertions (boolean formulas?)*

The second big point is that sometimes properties have *preconditions*, as we saw for invertibility on `Int`. A precondition specifies an additional restriction on the input. Only inputs that meet this restriction will be considered when testing the property.

## More Properties

Now we've learned a bit more about properties, see if you can come up with properties for the following functions:

- List length (`length` and `size` in the standard library)
- List append (`++` in the standard library)
- Sorting a list (`sorted` in the standard library)

_Any more?_


## Types and Tests

There is a long-standing debate in the programming community about the
relative merits of types versus tests in the context of reducing errors. On
one hand, a type is a proof of some property *for all* inputs, and the compiler
enforces this. For example, if you have a function that returns a value
of type `Boolean`, it *must* be the value `true` or the value `false`, and
*cannot* be anything else. And the compiler will reject your code if you
return any value that is not a `Boolean`. This may seem obvious, but it is also
quite amazing: the compiler has reduced the universe of possible errors from
*any* value of *any* type to just *two* possible values.

This compiles:

```tut:book
def isSomethingVeryComplicated(s: String): Boolean =
  if (???) true else false
```

But this doesn't:

```tut:book:fail
def isSomethingVeryComplicated(s: String): Boolean =
  "I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm a dog"
```

On the other hand, not all properties can be expressed by types, so for
these scenarios we can write tests. But it takes effort: not only do we have to express
our invariants, we need to provide inputs to test, and often we fail to be
sufficiently clever in our choices of inputs. (Or we're simply lazy and only
test the first thing that comes to mind.)

To summarize:

- **Types**
  - *Pros*: correct for all inputs; compiler-checked
  - *Cons*: don't handle all properties; the compiler can be annoying
- **Tests**
  - *Pros*: can prove complex properties we cannot express in types
  - *Cons*: more effort, more boilerplate; test inputs are cherry-picked; can only prove the presence of bugs

All is not lost though. Property-based testing bridges the gap: we can
check complex properties with many more inputs than we could manually
create ourselves. We do this by writing little programs that produce
(valid) test data.
